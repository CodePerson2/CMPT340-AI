requirements for CMPT340 inpainting group project

members: Shaoqiang Zou, Mattias Stroman, Che Yu Wu

This program is run on python3
using a few libraries

listed:

inpaint.py requires the installation of:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
sklearn
sklearn.linear_model
time
os
warnings
pathlib

makeNum.py requires installation of:
glob
cv2
numpy


installed using - pip install

To run makeNum.py: python makeNum.py ---------

change the location in the code to a folder with the dataset to be 
changed into numpy files

its defualt will be the folder of the code running and then /trainingData/images-224/*.PNG
most training data wont be provided based on its large memory size

To run inpaint.py: python inpaint.py -----------

change the path name at line 73 if X.npy isnt stored at the code files location.
X.npy is the numpy file holding the dataset. Its placed 
in there for ease of use when its being used in the algorithm

Pop ups will begin when you run the code and exiting them will keep the code running
